<h1>HMS Cumberland</h1>
<h3>Friday 24th Nov</h3>
<p>In the afternoon Midshipment Hamnet, Fluker and I joined the "Cumberland". She is in berth no 7, up Malay Cove. We arrived on board about 1600 and after our baggage had been efficiently dealt with we entered the gunroom. Mid. harris then showed us round the Upper Deck; it is not very difficult to find one's way around the ship as everything of course, is on such a much smaller scale that a battleship. We then saw Commander robson who said he would give us forty eight hours to learn something about the ship</p>
<h3>Saturday 25th Nov</h3>
<p>I spent the forenoon walking around the lower-deck, finding out numbers of messdecks and various other places of interest such as the Lower Steering Postion, 4" Calculating Positions, 8" T.S. and the Aodic(???) compartment. Eight 8" and eight 4" seem a pretty effective main and secondary armament for a cruiser but there seems to be rather a sparity of close range weapons.</p>
<p>At about 1000 the Captain saw us on the Quarter Deck. He gave us some useful advise and, among other things, warned us not "to leave our exams till the last moment". Personally I find it very difficult to do much work out here as the climate seems to completely sap one's energy.</p>
<p>The war news seems very satisfactory at the moment. Germany's outlook could not be much more black and it is rather surprising how stubbornly the Hun is fighting. Those parts of Germany now in Allied hands ar now fighting an all out campaign to win the peace. Such claims that "75% of the people are ant Nazi and have waited for months for the Allies" sound particularly ominous. It is to be hoped this propoganda will have no success but at any rate it is certain that it will carry no weight with countries which have been under German occupation. While on the subject I htink that Churchill's attitude towards Italy seems extremely weak. She is now being represented by an ambassador in London! Despite her dastardly attacks on Abyssynnia, Albania, Greece and France she is being treated like a long-lost ally.</p>
<h3>Sunday 26th Nov</h3>
<p>Divisions and church were held as usual. The former consisted of a march-past not an inspection.</p>
<p>The North-East Monsoon is breaking and for the last two days it has been comparatively cold; I only hope this continues. A drop of nearly 20 degrees on the thermometer is very pleasant indeed. I must say I'm rather envious of those in my last ship who are going to Sydney. I'm told it is an excellent climate.</p>
<p>In the evening we saw a film: "The Lamp Still Burns". It was the last production by Leslie Howard, who was unfortunately killed about a year ago, while flying back from Portugal</p>
<h3>Monday 27th Nov</h3>
<p>In the forenoon P.O. Redgrave, the Chief Boatswaing's mates gave us instruction in seamanship. I learnt quite a lot; apart from knowing the stuff very thoroughly himself he is able to explain it very clearly.</p>
<p>The recent changes in administration are now beginning to take place. The late C.in C Eastern Fleet, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, has, I'm told, flown to Australia to take up his appointment as C.in C. British Pacific Fleet. "Howe" has gone to Colombo to pick up his staff. Vice-Admiral Sir Arthur Power has been promoted and is taking up his appointment as C-in-C East Indies Fleet in H.M.S. "Caradoc"(???). Rear Admiral Walker, wearing his flag in "London", is now Senior Naval Officer Afloat.</p>
<p>In the evening the Gunroom Barber's Pole was stolen by a midshipman from the "London". Only two day ago "London" took "Howe's" Barber's Pole on the night before "Howe" left harbour. Thus there should now be two Barber's Poles in the "London"'s gunroom and by dint of hard fighting we should be able to retrieve one if not both.</p>
<h3>Tuesday 28th Nov</h3>
<p>The rain continues and it is still quite cold. Apart from seamanship instruction in the forenoon, this time by P.O. Mills, and a lecture on Radar by Lieutenant Blundell in the Dogs, I did very little today.</p>
<p>Life is exceptionally dull in this harbour but on the whole the morale of the troops is pretty good. Given more beer and better facilities ashore it would, of course, undoubtedly be improved. The shortage of water in this ship, or for that matter all ships in the harbour, seems to me to be rather unneccessary. There should be a far greater number of water-boats; this would enable them to come round regularly - say, three times a week. Considering that Trincomalee, apart from being an excellent natural harbour, is definitely a place of strategical importance. It seems incredible that it has not been developed better.</p>
<p>H.M.S. "Victorious" left harbour today.
<h3>Wednesday 29th Nov</h3>
<p>The weather became very bad and a gale warning was received. In consequence a 21/2" slip rope was rove aft and another 61/2" was flaked out ready for use. Boats were hoisted in and the quarter-deck awning was furled.</p>
<p>"Swiftsure" entered harbour today. She has only just come out from the U.K., in fact she was first commissioned last May. She is a modified Colony class cruiser. The only real difference is that she forfeits 'X' turret ( 3 6") for two 4" twin mountings. And, of course, she is equipped with the latest radar sets -277 (surface warning). We will not see much of her as she will be forming the new British Pacific Fleet.</p>
<h3>Thursday 30th Nov</h3>
<p>At about 0700 the Hands fell in to prepare for leaving harbour. At 0750 Special sea dutymen were sounded off and in less than an hour we had passed the boom. "London", flagship of the 5th C.S. was guide. We formed up in Order 1 - "Suffolk" 3 cables astern of "London" with us 3 cables astern of "Suffolk". The object of our putting to sea was a day's concentrated gunnery excercises. The first shoot was barrage firing at a sleeve target by both the 8" and 4". Next on the programme was a Dive Bombing Excercise. No firing, of course, but the Avengers were roaring down over the ship at every conceivable angle giving the close range weapons valuable practice at 'following'. At 1530 we carried out an Anti-Aircraft Blind Barrage Excercise throw-off shoot. 8" and 4" but I found it difficult to see what we were doing as there were such a number of different bursts. A Night Air Defence Excercise followed. On completion "London" departed and returned to Trincomalee. Being next senior ship we gook guide. At 1930 "Newcastle" joined company; Suffolk was despatched undependently to carry out her part as a 'surface raider' in the Night Encounter Excercise.</p>
<p>This commenced at 2030 - "Suffolk" acting as the raider with "Newcastle" and "Cumberland" defending. It was a bright moonlit night which was fortunate as our 273 Surface Warning et broke down and we were dependent on reports from "Newcastle" for our plot. The raider was reported at 23,000* and soon afterwards the Captain saw her and altered course toward. We then opened up with star-shell. It was not very accurate but Newcastle was also firing and had it been a pitch-black night "Suffolk" would undoubtedly have been well illuminated.</p>
<p>At 2240 the excercise was completed and we reduced to 16 knots to allow "Suffolk" to regain station. Course was due north until midnight.</p>
<h3>Friday 1st December</h3>
<p>Zig-zag no 11 was in force and we altered course twice during the night, at 0330 and 0550. At dawn Close Range firings were carried out, several runs were made by the towing aircraft until the sleeve was shot down. A Range and Inclination Excercise and then a Blind Radar Excercise followed. "Newcastle" left and we proceeded with a Throw-off shoot at "Suffolk" (this was in lieu of a Battle Practice Target which for some reason did not appear). We fired 16 salvoes in all -4 from each turret.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards all executive officers were piped to muster on the bridge for instruction in Anti Submaring procedure. The drill is as follows: On seeing a periscope, if before 60 degrees on either bow, speed is increased to 25 knots and course is altered towards . A W/T message should then be made to the shore authorities Comic T etc. A depth charge should be dropped every 500* at a depth setting of 50'. If the submaringe is abaft this bearing turn away and increase speed; again making reports by W/T.</p>
<p>Two P.C.O.s and two O.O.W.s were then chosen to take over for two dummy attacks. The periscope was represented by a dan-buoy with a red flag. Two depth-charges were dropped at each 'attack'.</p>
<p>Special Sea Dutymen and Cable Party were sounded off at 1400 and the Port watch cleaned into tropical rig and fell in for entering harbour. We came in astern to our berth. There was a fairly stong wind on our port beam which mad it difficult to keep our stern in line with the buoy(???Pic).</p>
<p>A tug was in attendance and she assisted in pushing our stern over to the stern buoy. We were secured by 1520.</p>
<h3>Saturday 2nd December</h3>
<p>A further stay in this harbour seems inevitable. Harbour routing in Trincomalee is exceedingly monotonous and the climate invites lethargy. Consequently I find writing up a journal somewhat laborious.</p>
<h3>Sunday 3rd December</h3>
<p>On Monday H.M.S. Black Prince and H.M.S. Argonaut entered harbour; they are recent additions to the Eastern Fleet but I imagine they will be going straight out to the Pacific. The former was in action off Normandy on D-day.</p>
<p>H.M.S. "London" is doing the next convoy duty to Australia. Rear Admiral Walker's staff has been temporarily posted ashore in Trincomalee. It is rumoured that our next move is a short stay at Palk Bay, on the northern tip of Ceylon.</p>
<p>At the moment, about 60% of our Marines are ashore on a 'jungle' course. It is very rigorous training and includes a route march to Colombo, a distance of 150 miles. They should be returning on Wednesday. On December 8th H.M.S. "Renown" left to go to Durban, where she will go into dock. As there is only one large dock, I presume that "Queen Elisabeth" will soon be returning to Trincomalee. The function of the East Indies Fleet is, as far as I can see, exactly the same as the old Eastern Fleet. It will doubtless be used in support of any landings in Burma, Malaya, Sumatra etc. Today the Daily Orders included a note about supplying the morring swivel in the foc'sle. This should be very interesting as one doesn't often get the opportunity of seeing the evolution of 'moor ship'(???) carried out.</p>
<p>In the evening an excellent boxing competition took place against the "Suffolk". It was raining quite hard but an awning was spread over the boxing ring and the whole thing went off very successfully. We beat the "Suffolk" by five fight to three.</p>
<h3>Friday 8th December</h3>
<p>During the forenoon the hands secured for going to sea. Awnings were furled and the stanchions stowed away. Life-lines were rigged and a slip wire was rove aft. At 1130 special sea dutymen was sounded off and at 1215 we passed the boom. Three quarter of an hour is pretty good going!</p>
<p>At 1400 the 4" action quarters closed up for a sleeve-target shoot. My action station is Officer of Quarter 4" (post). I like this very much as, before now, I have never had much idea as to what actually goes on 'at the guns'. The shoot was rather erratic and could not be classed as good. For these practice shoots all the ammunition is likely to be required is supplied beforehand by the Gunner's party. The system of ammunition supply in action firing is not very efficient on. On P2 the 2nd Motor Boat is very much in the way; it actually prevents ammunition coming up from the Upper Deck for the left gun. The whole system is rather clumsy and it is surprising that the 4" mountings were ever fitted in the H.A. gun deck rather that the Upper deck itself. Apart from anything else they increase top-weight!</p>
<p>Close-range firings then commenced. At 1545 a Fighter Direction Excercise and a Radar Height Calibration Excercise took place. At 1700 a floating target was dropped over the side and at a range of about 3000* the 4" opened fire on it in local. This was quite good considering both range and deflection had to be estimated. Something was seriously wrong with the deflection sight on P1. We opened fire with deflection of 10 left; the splashes were about 20 degrees to the right. after a series of 'left eights' we eventually started to straddle the target. On ceasing fire the sight was reading 72 knots left! The Gunnery Officer immediately  summoned an Ordnance Artificer(???) to check the sights. The 8" then opened fire with sub-calibre; the results were quite satisfactory. For the rest of the day we cruised up and down off Trincomalee so as to avoid passing through Palk Strait during the hours of darkness. The Hands were closed up...</p>
<p>NOON POSITION: Not available. 2000.8deg34'N,81deg34E</p>
<p>... in cruising watches throughout the night.</p>
<h3>Saturday 9th December</h3>
<p>We altered course to the northwards and proceeded at 16 knots. There was a three not current against us and we carried out zig-zag no 8. By dawn we had just passed ... light. We rounded Cape Pedro at 1030 and then entered Palk Strait. At one point there is only 51/2 fathoms and as we draw 221/2 feet there was not very much to spare. We steamed on towards Adam's Bridge and at 1430 we let go the starboard anchor and came to off the eastern end of Pambau Island. The island is joined to the mainland of India by a steel bridge which, in the centre, acts as a drawbridge to allow small vessels to pass through. The 1st Motor-boat was lowered and several senior officers went off to try and find out what facilities there were for putting the men ashore. They did not get inshore owing to the dangerous coral reefs. Later N.O.I.C. (in charge of a base for M.T.B.s) sent a signal to the effect that there was a jetty and also that he could arrange some cinema performances. The swell, however, was considerable and it was not possible to take advantage of his offer.</p>
<h3>Sunday 10th December</h3>
<p>Divisions took place as usual but there was no march past. Later in the forenoon the Captain invited all officers to a glass of wine on the quarter-deck. Wine and conversation flowed quite freely and I got to know quite a few officers whom I had hardly seen before.</p>
<p>Both cutters and both whalers took part in the Sailing race; there was a pretty strong breeze and the boats were moving along very nicely. A lot has been done to 'entertain the troops' during our short stay here. There is not much to do ashore and the more recreation taken on board the better. In the Dogs the Gunroom were challenged by the Wardroom to a game of deck coits. The latter won 2-1. Mud fishing has been taking place over side and a price of 10/- has been offered for the largest fish. So far nothing very large has been caught although Doctor Bealby caught a baby shark this afternoon! In the evening the film "My Sister Eileen" was shown on the quarter-deck. In some parts it was very witty but on the whole it was not a very good film.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the ship is shifting anchorage to a point off the South Eastern tip of Delft Islands, a distance of 37 miles. It has been decreed that the following midshipmen are to take the ship to sea:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Midshipmen
		<ul>
			<li>Roebuck representing the Captain
			<li>Trewhella representing the Commander
			<li>Hughes representing the First Lieutenant
			<li>Rickard representing the Navigating Officer
			<li>Fluker representing the Gunnery Officer
			<li>Llewelyn representing the O.O.W.
			<li>Ree (Sub-Lt) representing the Commander (E)
			<li>Greig representing the Engineer O.O.W.
			<li>Parshan representing the Ch. Yeo. Sigs.
			<li>Hammett representing the Signalman on F.X.
		</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Monday 11th December</h3>
<p>I had to go down to the Engine Room at 0400 and then to the Boiler Room (for'ard) for 'flashing up'. Only four boilers were required and so only one boiler room was used, we did not prepare to steam in units(???). Personally I am not very interested in it but I quite see that it is essential to know the duties of the Engine room department especially if you are likely to have to give them orders from the bridge.</p>
<p>It was ordered that we should be shortened in to two shackles by 0710 and the anchor to be away by 0715. The ship was 15 minutes late, the fly in the ointment being the Daily Orders:</p>
<ul>
	<li>0600 Call the Hands.
	<li>0630 Hands fall in Special Sea Dutymen, Cable Party etc to breakfast.
	<li>0645 Steam on the capstan
	<li>0655 Cable Party (Port Watch), Special Sea Dutymen close up etc. etc.
	<li>0715 Anchor to be away. Hands to breakfast. Stand fast S.S.D. and C.P.
</ul>
<p>POSITION AT 0800: 9deg24'N,79deg15'E</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above this only allowed 20 minutes for the anchor to be weighed. To add to this much time had to be used in scrubbing the cable - the bottom being exceptionally muddy - and consequently it was 0730 before the anchor was away. The midshipmen then secured.</p>
<p>At 1000, off the South-Eastern end of Delft Island, the port anchor was let go and a few minutes later the starboard anchor. Eventually ... was middled and the evolution of Moon ship was executed. It was completed in very good time and I, for one, found it extremely instructive.</p>
<p>We then unmoored ship and left the starboard anchor at shackles.</p>
<h3>Tuesday 12th Dec.</h3>
<p> The Captain gave permission for all midshipmen to go ashore at 0800 til 1600. Sub.Lt Ree managed to get hold of an old 12-bore shot gun. We went in the 2nd motor boat which anchored about 50 yards off shore and the skiff took us the rest of the way. There was nothing much to do as there was only one gun beween the sixteen of us. However we decided to go for a long and vigorous walk round the coast of the island. It was sparsely populated; even now and then we came across a tiny fishing community. More or less in the centre is the main village consisting of a church, school and a few drabby huts. The school-master spoke quite good English. On our way back we encountered the 'shooting party' which had accounted for 10 doves. It then began to rain and after an hour or so of drenching, we returned to the ship on the libertymen's boat. The latter were also soaked through but were nevertheless enjoying themselves immensely! On the whole I enjoyed the day very much indeed and it made a welcome change from the ordinary routine. In the afternoon, apparently, aquatic sports were held and they went off very successfully.</p>
<h3>Wednesday 13th Dec</h3>
<p>Whilst at Palk Strait the Hands are having a comparative rest-cure. They are called at 0630 (usual routine 0600) and do not fall in until 0810. In the forenoon the Royal Marines practised firing at a target with a Bren gun, their fire was exceptionally accurate. A gunnery instruction film was then shown in the Fore Cabin Flat. The subject dealt mainly with Fine Control. Port(???) watch carried out platoon drill.</p>
<p>In the afternoon another sailing race was held, it was won by the E.R.A's cutter coxswained by Lt(E)Riseborough. A rifle shooting competition took place and was won by the R.M. bande; the Gunroom came fourth.</p>
<h3>Thursday 14th Dec.</h3>
<p>This morning at 0900 'Clear Lower Deck' was sounded off and the hands mustered on the fo'csle. The Commander addressed the Ship's Company on the subject of Damage Control. A C.A.F.O. has recently come out demanding that all men pass a preliminary test in Damage Control. A more extensive test has to be passed by men passing for leading seamen and petty officer. Lt(E) Humby, Damage Control Officer, then got up and stressed the importance of efficient Damage Control. He gave source examples making reference to H.M.S "Argonaut", "Nigeria" and "Ark Royal". After this the Ship's Company mustered in their various ness decks and Divisional officers told their men further details of what was required. At 1700 the Hands secured for sea. Being the only ship at Palk Strait all boats were hoisted, all booms and ladders secured for sea</p>
<h3>Friday 15th December</h3>
<p>Special Sea Dutymen and Cable Party were sounded off at 0715 and the ship was shortened in to 2 shackles in just under half an hour. The anchor was away shortly after 0800.</p>
<p>In the forenoon the ship's company underwent a respirator test in the Gas chamber</p>
<p>NOON POSITION: 9deg44'N,80deg20.3'E</p>
<p>On the way back we received reports of a U-boat. When in the danger area speed was increased to 28 knots and the order 'Stand by to throw depth-charges' was given. Nothing occurred. At about 1330 the 4" Action Quarters closed up; the shoot was to be an ordinary sleeve-target one but unfortunately the aeroplane seemed unable to stream its sleeve. Eventually it returned to base. The Gunnery Officer came down to the guns and gave then drill (firing) in quarter firing. There were only two other excercises on the programme, a Fighter Direction Excercise and a Radar Height Calibration Excercise.</p>
<p>On Completion we returned to harbour to find H.M.S. "King George V" in the berth just ahead of us and the new carrier "Indefatigable" also in harbour. The depot ship "Tyne" had also arrived. All the ships I've just mentioned have only recently left Home waters. Both "Amson"(???) and "Duke of York" are now in dock leaving "Rodney" flagship of a comparatively small Home Fleet.</p>
<p>"K.G.V" carries Vice-Admiral Rawl British Pacific Fleet No 7 BERTH</p>
<h3>Saturday 16th Dec</h3>
<p>Further changes in administration have been made. Rear Admiral Walker has been promoted to Vice-Admiral and is now V.A. 3rd Battle Squadron. The latter comprises H.M. ships "London", (flag) "Renown", "Queen Elisabeth", "Cumberland" and "Suffolk".</p>
<h3>Sunday 17th Dec.</h3>
<p>In the forenoon the Captain did mess dick rounds and 'Quarter clean guns' was sounded off. H.M.S. "Argonaut" left harbour at 0750.</p>
<p>In the forenoon divisions were held as usual but the Captain came round inspection instead of having a march-past. The church service was somewhat interrupted by Catalinas taking off; there are a number of Catalinas berthed up Malay Cove and there is a continual row of planes, either Catalinas or others from China Bay Aerodrome.</p>
<p>In the evening I had some visitors over from "King George V"; they seemed to have had a very enjoyable time coming across from U.K., calling in at Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Port Said and Port Tewfic. She will, I presume, shortly be going off to join the newly-formed British Pacific Fleet. The film 'Girl Crazy', starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland was shown on the Quarter Deck.</p>
<p>We received news today of a German counte-attack on the Western Front. Runstedt is back in command and grom all accounts some very fierce fighting is taking place. It is to be hoped that this is the last and final efforts of a defeated army.</p>
<h3>Monday 18th December</h3>
<p>"London" left at about 1800 yesterday for Freemantle. V.A. 3 had transferred his flag to "Suffolk". "Suffolk" shifted berth to no 4 (next to Naval Head Quarters) and we secured in no 5 berth. I was not up on deck as we have now started a short Engineering syllabus and got quite a good idea of what goes on below when the ship is manoeuvring.</p>
<p>Various 'buzzes' are spreading round the ship and the S. branch look particularly self-satisfied. The Engine-Room staff have been told to get their 'Defeat lists' up to dat so it looks as if we will be going in to dock. The question is WHERE? An oiler was alongside for most of the day.</p>
<p>The aircraft carrier "Indomitable" and "Illustrious" and the cruisers "Newcastle", "Black Prince" and "Achilles" left harbour presumably destined for the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Americans have been making more succussful landing in the Phillipines, this time on the island of Mindoo(???)</p>
<h3>Tuesday 19th December</h3>
<p>Today it was definitely announced that we were going to Simonstown for a short re-fit. Unfortunately the four senior midshipmen are leaving the ship as they are doing their exams at the beginning of next month. Three midshipmen from the "Suffolk" joined today to replace those leaving.</p>
<p>At about 1500 the "Queen Elizabeth" entered harbour, she has just returned from a refit in Durban. The dock she was in is now occupied by "Renown". Midshipman Parshar joined "Queen Elizabeth", he left this ship owing to the fact that there is a very strong colour bar in South Africa. Surgeon Lieutenant Da Cunha(???) also left.</p>
<h3>Wednesday 20th December</h3>
<p>Several officers, including a Commander by the name of Mannsell, came on board for passage. At 1700 ht Hands secured for sea. A slip rope was reeved aft and one of the two stern 41/2" wires was unshackled.</p>
<p>"Nigeria" left early this morning and "Ceylon" arrived during the afternoon. The latter has been away for some time. V.A.3 transferred his flag to "Queen Elisabeth" today.</p>
<h3>Thursday 21st Dec.</h3>
<p>We put to sea at 0730. Everything went very smoothly and the tug in attendance had nothing to do. We are cruising at a speed of 19 knots, zig-zag no 8. At 1545 Clear Lower Deck was sounded off and then Hands to Abandon Ship stations. Fluker, Hammet and myself are keeping watches down in the Engine-Room. It is not so much hard sork as hot work.</p>
<p>1810 a/c 228deg</p>
<p>We are keeping one watch in three as do the Stokers. The latter seem very hard worked as they also have to do Damage Control watches during the day. When not on watch they ....</p>
<p>NOON POSITION: 07deg50'N,81deg58'E</p>
<p>... have to attend Evening quarters. Unless a muster(???) is read out I fail to see any rhyme or reason for having Evening Quarters. At 1700 the coast of Ceylon was still in sight. During the day we met H.M.Ships "Undaunted" and "Ursa", S.S. "Temagin and Trevelyn".</p>
<h3>Friday 22nd December</h3>
