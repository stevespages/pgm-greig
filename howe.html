<h1>HMS Howe</h1>
<h2>At Scarpa</h2>
<h3>Wednesday 28th June</h3>
<p>0700. Having waited a somewhat tedious 7 hours in the ward-room of "Dunluce(???) Castle" I was told that "Howe's" drifter was alongside. Calling in at Gibraltar Pier we waited sometime before seeing "Howe" entering the Flow on completion of gunnery excercises. Soon I was climbing up the forward gangway and winding my way to the gunroom. After supper I was told to go and help direct the baggage, which had been brought aft onto the Q.D. In a short time everything was stowed in the appropriate chest-flats. I then drew a hammock and bedding and turned in for the night.</p>
<h3>Thursday 29th June</h3>
<p>The newly joined midshipmen were ordered to muster in the mid's study. First the sub addressed us, then the First Liutenant and finally the 'Schoolie'. Both the former stressed several useful points, not the least of which was the tact and good behaviour needed when being instructed by a P.O. or rating. We then saw the Gunnery Officer and told him the previous stations we had had in gunnery. The jobs we have been given are pretty useless but owing to the superfluous number of mids. this is inevitable. Nothing much of importance took place as regards the ships. In the morning C.A. ammunitioning was carried out; the red lead on the fore-mast was painted over, greatly improving the ship's appearance.</p>
<h3> Friday 30th June</h3>
<p> Hands were called early in the morning and preparations were made for putting to sea. We weighed and proceeded southwards towards our destination, Grenock. Soon the 5.25 armament had closed up and practice firing at winged and sleeve targets commenced. I was not closed up myself and I was able to get a good spectator's view of the proceedings; I was much impressed by the accuracy of the firing which was naturally considerably superior to that of my last ship's owing to more modern equipment. The pom-poms and Oeslious(???) then opened up at similar targets, these shoots were also good but it strikes me that a well-trained man on an open Oerlikon(???) sight can be almost as accurate as a man using the new gyro gun sights. P.V.'s had been stramed and the ship maintained a speed of approximately 20 knots. During the Dogs the Captain addressed all newly-joined midshipmen on the Admiral's bridge. He said that he regarded mids. as officers and not as useful messengers to have around the ship; this, however, could only be applied if they themselves played their part, and behaved as officers. Midshipmen had ample opportunities for influencing the ship's company because they were in closer contact with the men than more senior officers. This was the gyst of his speech, which also included many other interesting points.</p>
<p>"Wakeful" and "Wager" formed our destroyers escort.</p>
<h3>Saturday 1st July</h3>
<p>Special sea dutymen was piped at 0540, their main job was to prepare derricks etc. ready for immediate use when the numerous drifters started to come alongside.</p>
<p>Very soon we anchored, mail, aircraft parts, mines, and miscellaneous supplies began littering the Upper Deck. I was detailed to keep a tally of all G.P.O mail being stowed in the Captain's quarters; here alone over 800 large bags accumulated. Close range communicating began. After a hard day's work the ship was ready to go to sea with, the Commander informed us later, the first port of call Algiers. At about 2200 we weighed and proceeded down the clyde; this time we were escorted by "LLudin"(???), "LLandunted"(???) and "LLchin". The ship went north abouts leaving Ireland on her port side.</p>
<h3>Sunday July 2nd</h3>
<p>Throughout the day we steamed approximately South-West, well out into the Atlantic; we were doing a large sweep on our way to Gibraltar in order to avoid packs of U-boats based off France. No gunnery excercises were ordered. The armament closed up includes one 5.25 director and turret either side, four Pom-poms (one forward, one aft and one on either beam) and about one third of the total number of Oestlrs(???). This seems to be a more or less permament arrangement under normal circumstances. No aircraft was sighted this day although Radar picked up several contacts and soon identified them as friendly aircraft. By now I was more or less getting used to my job on the A.W.P(???) The communication system confused me most at first, whenever a buzz or howl made itself heard I had not the faintest idea which phone to pick up.</p>
<h3>Monday 5th July</h3>
<p>In the afternoon star-shell excercises were carried out in preparation for the night encounter excercise. Hitherto no ship had been allowed to fire star-shell with full-charge but before we left Scapa the Gunnrey Officer was informed that it could be done with perfect safety. This was the reason for these excercidse.</p>
<p>In the afternoon 'Guns' gave a lecture to all Target Selection Officers. He emphasised that it was not just a 'stooge' job but was quite a responsible duty. I was closed up at a Pom-pom during the Night Encounter excercise; the first shoot was very poor and the destroyer was not illuminated; the second shoot was good.</p>
<p>Very little happened on this day as far as I was concerned. I spent some long and tedious hours on the A.D.P. doing practically nothing. Another Night Encounter excercise was ordered; at about 2200, however, the Gunnery Officer made an announcement over the T.I. broadcast. He said that a convoy had been attacked by F.W. 200's whilst in our present position, on the previous night. defence stations were piped. Actually there were very few aircraft in the vicinity that night.</p>
<h3>wednesday 5th July</h3>
<p>This day the usual star-shell practices were carried out, this time using "Lladaunted"(???) as the target. In the afternoon the Close Range suddenly opened fire at a mine but there was no explosion; this could hardly be exected as the burst was about 200 yards away from the mine! Later our destroyer escort was changed. "Brilliant", "Active" and "Wolverine" replaced the original three; the latter went on to refuel at Gib. As these destroyers closed on us an aircraft was reported by Radar bearing right astern distance 10 miles. This created much consternation on the A.D.P. as it was soon reported at 4 miles and still the look-outs could not see anything. Then we were informed that it was a back echo and the order RELAX was given. A course was set East for Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>Thursday 6th July</h3>
<p>Tropical kit was ordered but the weather was considerably colder than it had been the previous day. I was on watch during the forenoon but the A.D.O(???) told me I could go down to the A.I.C. for the first hour. It was very interesting but rather complicated; an excercise was being carried out. The F.D.O. was directing imaginary aircraft at imaginary raids; for the purpose of the excercise Carlile was taking the part of pilot in a fighter. He soon reported 'Grand Slam' which I discovered later means 'all enemy aircraft driven away or shot down!' As we were going through the Straits (about midnight) Repel Aircraft Stations were sounded owing to an Air Raid Warning Red. Nothing occured. Blimps were patrolling the Straits.</p>
<h3>Friday 7th July</h3>
<p>In the forenoon our original destroyer escort took over again. At about 1900 we had reached Algiers but had to wait until the Harbour authorities decided on our berth. Tugs took over but just as our stern was swinging round to get in line with the jetty a disaster occured. our stern hit the bows of the French battleship "Lorraine". Her cable was cut and some serious damage was done to our port outer screw; divers are now investigating</p>

<h3>Saturday 8th July</h3>
<p>I spent most of the forenoon writing up my journal as I had rather neglected it at sea. I then went ashore in Algiers and found it much as I had expected. About three of us hitchhiked along the coast to Franco Bay, here we had a very refreshing swin but got uncomfortably sun-burnt in the process. I then returned to the ship and shifted into No 10's; it was the first time I had worn this rig and I found it foully hot about the collar. I had dinner at some Officer's club and sampled some of the local wines. at about midnight I got back and turned in.</p>
<h3>Sunday July 9th</h3>
<p>The previous day's buzz that we were goint to sea at 1700, was soon confirmed. I was understudying in the launch and we had quite a few trips taking most of the Starboard watch to the other side of the Mole, for bathing. The ship proceded to sea at about 1730; everything went well this time. Soon 'Action Stations' was piped and a successful shoot was carried out. Our destroyer escort also opened fire at the sleeve targets; starting off rather shakily, their fire was soon very accurate and somethimes more accurate that our 5.25's. High speed trials were very successful, it seems that the damage sustained by the port outer screw was practically negligible despite the most fantastic rumours that were spreading round the ship after the first diver had been down! In the evening I went and saw the film; it was not very good but provided some form of entertainment.</p>
<h3>Monday July 10th</h3>
<p>I took a sun-run-sun but worked it out wrong; by the time I had done the afternoon & first watches and taken some sleep, there was no point in correcting it as the 24 hour time limit was up. Our 'air cover' comprised 1 Wellington, 2 Baltimores or Beanfighters and either 2 or 4 Spitfires. we had a very energetic time on the A.D.P as these places were constantly being ncleived(???);apart from this the A.D.R frequently wanted information as to where our escorts were. During the afternoon we met a large convoy. I, myself, counted 47 convoy vessels and about 12 corvettes. They literally stretched from horizon to horizon since they were more or less in line ahead. At about 1530 we passed Cape Bon; along the coast we could see many wrecks, proof, if need be, of Rommel's unorganised and hasty retreat last year. The commander announced that our destination was Port Said.</p>
<h3>Tuesday July 11th</h3>
<p>We continued to steam East through the Mediterrannean, there was no land in sight for some time until we passed Benghazi. It was extremely interesting passing these places which had acquired such fame during the libyan campaign. In the evening the Commander informed up that now we had passed Crete, the only remaining danger was opposite Alex (there had been an air-raid there the night before(. We therefore turned back on our tracks in order to mark time. It was a bright moon-light night and would no doubt have proved disastrous had there been any aircraft in the vicinity</p>
<h3> Wednesday July 12th</h3>
<p>We turned East again. I decided that I had better take a sun-sight to stop 'Schoolie' from complaining when we reached Port Said. It was reasonably successful but not very accurate. At about 0200 (the next day) we passed Alexandria. The moon did not appear until 0230 and when it did it was partially obscured by cloud. Nothing occurred during the night but everyone was on 'top-line'.</p>
<h3>Thursday July 13th</h3>
<p>We were due to reach Port Said about mid-day. I fell in in the starboard waist(???) with the Close Range division and from there watched the proceedings. Our stern was tugged round to port and before it was secured we dropped both anchors and swung round slowly but surely. The operation was carried out very skillfully and soon everything was ready for the lighters to come alongside. I forgot to mention that the Commander had previously announced that a hard day's work was ahead as 350 14" shells had to be transported from "Y" turret to the foc'sle to decrease the draught astern, when we entered the canal. The hard work began. I was detailed to help supervise the shell stowage for'ard. By midnight the job was completed. We were to enter the canl at 0500 the next morning.</p>
<h3>Friday July 14th</h3>
<p>We weighed anchor early in the morning and the ship began the rather hazardous task of steaming through the Suez Canal. This is the heaviest ship so far to make this passage. Apart from ripping the cables of one or two buyous everything went well for some time; then an unfortunate incident occured. The ship was being conned from the Armoured Conning Tower and not the Lower Steering Position; one of the Q.M.'s crew leant against a button and by so doing changed the steering from electrical to steam. When the time came to round a bend there was much confusion and several people were at fault. We went aground but our stern was soon handed out by the tug 'Atlas'. At about 1600 we passed Ismalia. The place looked reasonably civilised with a few really nice grass lawns; the barren expanse on the port side and Ismalia on the starboard side provided an amazing contrast. We then proceeded to anchor in the Great Bitten Lake and bathing parties were organised over the ship's side. I took a dip and found it too salt to be really enjoyable though it was very refreshing. We heard the news that a great three-gold offensive in Europe had opened up; allied troops in russia, Normandy and Italy were all on the attack. I am looking forward to reading a newspaper again (not to mention mail!)</p>
<h3>Saturday July 15th</h3>
<p>At 0500 we weighed anchor and entered the Little Bitten (???) Lake. First after 0615 we went aground in the marked channel; although our helm was hard a starboard, our port engines going full ahead and our starboard engines full astern, the port bow wedged itself firmly onto 'terra firma'. A tug astern and a tug ahead managed to clear us. The ship was scheduled to reach Suez by about noon but a few more delays sit in. At 1400 we dropped the hook and boats were hoisted out. I was understudying in the motor cutter; just as it was growing dark we were detailed to take 53 evaporator tube ashore. Our instructions were very vague; we were told to go to Portwall Signal Station to dump these tubes. It was a very difficult trip as we were definitely overloaded with about 6" of feeboard. Mind Ms(???) Griffin fortunately had had much experience in these boats and we made the trip pretty successfully. The difficulty lay in finding Portwall Signal Station; we overstepped the mark by several piese(???) and finally reached some jetty. Unfortunately the place was monopolised by natives who gave us very misleading instructions, directing us to the Egyptian Signal Station. The Coxswain and I went ashore with the intention of signalling to Mw(???)Griffin when we were ata the right Pics(???). After tramping some very smelly streets we reached Portwall Signal Station and signalled numerous ".-."s (pre-arranged signal) out into darkness over the canal. To our great relief we saw the flash of an Aldis lamp. The boata, incidentally, was fitted with no navigation lights. We also managed to contact the man who was to tell us where to put the tubes; he directed us to another jetty and unloading began. We had 10 stokers in the boaats and although each tube had to be handed up separately we did not take long. I took the tiller on the way back and although we had just done the trip inshore I did not find it too easy as there were so many coloured lights flashing that I had some difficulty in keeping in the buoyed channel. We got back onboard at about midnight.</p>
<h3>Sunday July 16th</h3>
<p>I was on boats until 12.30 but for some reason we had no trips at all. I went ashore during the afternoon and evening. Although Port Suez was a pretty filthy place the natives seemed considerably cleaner than those at Algiers; at least you didn't find them lying around in the gutters! I bought a camera for 200 Piastes(???) having spent about ten minutes knocking the chap down from 500! I then went and saw a film at an open air cinema; it was really extremely pleasant and somehow the sound was very clear indeed. I expect they use some special acoustic apparatus for such cimemas.</p>
