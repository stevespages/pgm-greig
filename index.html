<h1>Philip Guy Moorland Greig's War Diary</h1>
<img src="cover.jpg" width=100%>
<p>Philip joined Dartmouth Naval Training College at the age of 13. In 1944 when he was 17 he joined H.M.S. Warspite. He served on her during the D-Day invasion and then served on H.M.S. Howe and H.M.S Cumberland before World War 2 finally ended. As part of his training he was asked to keep a record of his time on these ships. That record is reproduced here. Much of his record deals with the history of the ships he served in and the historical context that he found himself in. The more personal parts of his record are coloured blue here so they can be easily identified.</p>
