<h1>Philip Guy Moorland Greig's War Diary</h1>
<p>Philip Greig joined Dartmouth Naval Training College at the age of 13. In 1944 when he was 17 he joined H.M.S. Warspite. He served on her during the D-Day invasion of Normandy and then served on H.M.S. Howe and H.M.S Cumberland before World War 2 finally ended. As part of his midshipman training he was asked to keep a record of his time on these ships. That record is reproduced here.</p>
